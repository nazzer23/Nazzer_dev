# Nazzer.dev - Version 1
## What is this?
This entire repository is the platform that is powering https://nazzer.dev.
The basis of this platform, was written within a week of designing, developing and testing.

At the time of writing, it contains the following functionality:
+ Listing of Articles
+ Category organization
+ Modular template system
---
## Things to consider implementing
The following are what I am considering or even planning to implement into the system:
+ Administration Panel - Definitely
    - Implementation of editing templates
    - Article Management
        - Adding
        - Deleting
        - Modifying
        - Scheduling posts
- Images within articles
    - If this does get added, administration panel will support this.
- Commenting on Articles
    - Probably use a 3rd party application for this, if not, users will be required to register.
- Management roles for multi-posting
    - Will allow for social media publishing if implemented.
